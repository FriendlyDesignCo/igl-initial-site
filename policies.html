      	<h3>Policies</h3>
          <p><h4>Code of Conduct</h4>
          NOLA Gaming Fest is a family and friend oriented convention, and we would like all attendees of our convention to have fun and be safe. The main rule is “be polite and friendly;” the rest is just clarification.</p>

          <p>Harassment: NOLA Gaming Fest does not tolerate harassment of any kind, be it based on race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, height, weight, planet of origin, or any other physical or civilized beliefs. This goes for all attendees, guests, panelists, staff, and/or hotel employees. Harassment is defined as derogatory comments, stalking, aggressive behavior, unnecessary intentional physical blocking of others, or altercations of any sort. If you believe you have been a victim of harassment, please find NOLA Gaming Fest Security as soon at it occurs. If you are unable to find a security guard or you are not satisfied with how a security guard handle the situation, call 504-444-7536 to get in touch with the event organizer.</p>

          <p><h4>General Rules</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>No one under the age of 13 will be allowed to attend without a paid parent or legal guardian registrant accompanying him/her at all times; no one under the age of 18 will be allowed to attend without consent of a parent or legal guardian.</li>
            <li>Please do not damage the convention space. We like the Pontchartrain Center and the Pontchartrain Center likes us, and we want to keep it that way. This includes painting or sketching on walls, slamming doors, etc. Please do not hang any flyers on any wall or other surface of the convention space; we will have a specialized area for hanging/placing flyers.</li>
            <li>Please wear your attendee wristband so that they are clearly visible at all times. There will be wristband checkers throughout the convention space and you will be asked to return with your wrist band if you do not have it on you in order to access convention areas.</li>
            <li>Many hallways have tape on the floor to indicate “traffic lanes” (where we need to keep moving), “parking areas” (where we can stand and hang out), “caution areas” (where we need to keep moving/be careful, i.e. tops and bottoms of escalators), “restricted areas” (where we should only for a specific purpose), and “photo areas” (where you can take pictures) are. Please keep an eye out for this tape and respect any NOLA Gaming Fest or Pontchartrain Center staffer who is trying to keep the hallways moving and doorways clear; a lot of people are trying to get to different places they want to go in the convention.</li>
            <li>NOLA Gaming Fest and the Pontchartrain Center are not responsible for missing items. Any bag(s) or other item left unattended around the convention space will likely be picked up by either a NOLA Gaming Fest staffer or another attendee and be taken to Lost and Found in NOLA Gaming Fest Security (in the Prince George’s Coat Check on the Exhibition Hall level) or to the Pontchartrain Center; please check with both places to locate your item. The item may be turned over to the police if deemed necessary.</li>
            <li>Please don’t run, play tag, or throw things inside the convention space. Also, please don’t carry a radio, iPod, or other device that is playing music at a loud volume (only you should be able to hear it).</li>
            <li>NOLA Gaming Fest reserves the right to refuse admission to any individual and to eject persons from the event locations.</li>
            <li>Don't mess with things that aren't yours.</li>
            <li>Don't Steal. If you are caught stealing, you will be escorted from the venue by the on-duty police officer.</li>
            <li>Don't fight or otherwise engage in an action that could bring physical harm to yourself or others.</li>
            <li>Don't cheat. If you are caught cheating in a competitive setting, you will ejected from the event and banned from future competitions.</li>
        </ol>
        </P>
         <p><h4>Cosplay Prop Guidelines</h4>
            To ensure the general safety of NOLA Gaming Fest’s attendees, we can’t allow people to carry the following types of weapons or cosplay props:
        <ul>
          <li>Live steel of any kind, including knives, swords, axes, martial arts equipment, shurikens, etc.</li>
          <li>Any other type of bladed weapon.</li>
          <li>Any weapon/prop that can currently, or could in the past, shoot a projectile (“projectile” includes water, aerosols/sprays, Airsoft guns with/without ammo or air, toy bows, etc.)</li>
          <li>Anything generally awkward to carry, or that can’t be controlled by the person carrying (i.e., it is so heavy, you are consistently dropping it in the hallway, or cannot keep it from swinging into other attendees). NOLA Gaming Fest staff will be the final determinant as to whether something is too awkward or too dangerous to be carried around the convention.</li>
        </ul>
        </P>
          <p><h4>Dress Code</h4>
          While NOLA Gaming Fest does not have a dress code of our own, we strongly support the wishes of our fine hosting facility, the Pontchartrain Center.
        <ul>
          <li>All Attendees must have their private areas covered at all times.</li>
          <li>Material must extend at least one (1) inch above the nipple and below/to the sides of the breast, and at least one (1) inch above the pubic area and below the crotch/buttocks.</li>
          <li>This coverage must remain in place while moving/bending/posing/etc., so if your cosplay (or street clothes) rides up/down, please extend it, find a way to secure it, or wear something under it.</li>
          <li>Shirt coverings must be worn at all times, by both sexes.</li>
          <li>Mesh shirts are allowed if they provide the require coverage of sensitive areas.</li>
          <li>Tape over the nipples will not suffice.</li>
          <li>Capes will not be accepted in place of shirts – if you’re wearing one, please wear a shirt underneath.</li>
          </p>
